OceanofPDF .com Introduction
Almost exactly one hundred years ago, an expedition led by the
Englishman How ard Carter unearthed some long-buried steps in the Valley
of Kings  in Egypt. The steps led to a doorway with royal seals, signifying
that it was the tomb of a pharaoh. The seals were intact, meaning that
nobody had entered for more than three thousand years. Even Carter , a
seasoned Egyptologist,  was awestruck by what they found inside: the
mummified young pharaoh Tutankhamun, with his magni ficent gold
funerary mask, kept company in the tomb for millennia by a wealth of
ornate and beaut iful artifacts. The tombs had been secured shut so that mere
mortals could not enter—the Egyptians had gone to enormous efforts to
create objects never intended to be seen by other people.
The splendor of the tomb was part of an elaborate ritual aimed at
transcending death. Guarding the entrance to a room of treasures was a gold
and black statue of Anubis, the jackal-headed god of the underworld, whose
role is described in The Egyptian Book of the Dead . A scroll of the book
was often placed in the pharaoh’ s sarcophagus. We may be tempted to think
of it as a religious work, but it was more akin to a travel guide, containing
instructions for navigating the treacherous underworld passage to reach a
blissful afterlife. In one of the final tests, Anubis weighs the heart of the
deceased agains t a feather . If the heart is found to be heavier , it is impure,
and the person is condemned to a horrible fate. But if the exam inee is pure,
he would enter a beautiful land filled with eating, drinking, sex, and all the
other pleasures of life.
The Egyptians were hardly alone in their beliefs of transcendin g death
with an eternal afterlife. Although other human cultures may not have
constructed such elaborate monuments as the Egyptians did for their
royalty , all of them had beliefs and rituals around death. It is fascinating to consider how we humans first became aware of our
mortality . That we are aware of death at all is something of an accident,
requiring the evolution of a brain that is capable of self-awareness. Very
likely it needed the development of a certain level of cognition and the
ability to generalize as well as the development of language to pass on that
idea. Lower life forms and even complex ones such as plants, don’t
perceive death. It simply happe ns. Animals and other sentient beings may
instinctively fear danger and death. They recognize when one of their own
has died, and some are even known to mourn them. But there is no evidence
that anim als are aware of their own mortality . I do not mean being killed by
an act of violence, an accident, or a preventable illness. Instead, I mean the
inevitability  of death.
At some point, we humans realized that life is like an eternal feast that
we join when we are born. While we are enjoying this banquet, we notice
others arriving and departing. Eventually it is our turn to leave, even though
the party is still in full swing. And we dread going out alone into the cold
night. The knowledge of death is so terrifying that we live most of our lives
in denia l of it. And when someone dies, we struggle to ackno wledge that
straightforwardly , and instead use euphemisms such as “passed away” or
“departed,” which suggest that death is not final but merely a transition to
something else.
To help humans cope with their k...
